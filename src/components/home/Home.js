        Can you guess the artist? This quiz is unique and fun because it
        involves a series of popular song lyrics, and you have to imagine who
        sung the song. For someone who is a fan of music, this may be a total
        breeze. Those who are not as familiar with music can learn something. To
        paly the game you need to sign up first.

      <p>Good Luck!</p>
